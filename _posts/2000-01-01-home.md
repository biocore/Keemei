    <strong>Upcoming Service Disruption!</strong>
  </span>
  <p>
    Keemei will be unavailable beginning <strong>Friday March 2nd</strong>, at
    approximately 12p (Eastern), and will be unavailable until some time during
    the week of March 5th (more on that below).
  </p>
  <p>
    The Keemei team is performing maintenance related to the Google account
    used to publish Keemei. In particular, we will be moving Keemei from one
    Google account to another, but due to some technical limitations with the
    Google Add-ons platform, the only way we can accomplish that task if by
    first unpublishing the existing Keemei release, and then "republishing"
    Keemei from the new Google Account.
  </p>
  <p>
    For existing users of Keemei, we aren't entirely sure what this will look
    like, but we expect that Keemei will be unavailable during this outage
    window. As well, we anticipate you will likely need to re-authorize and
    re-install Keemei, once it is relaunched under the new Google Account. We
    will post instructions when that time comes.
  </p>
  <p>
    We apologize for the inconvenience, and we will work as quickly as possible
    to minimize this disruption, but the unpublishing and republishing steps
    are out of our hands, because these are subject to review by the Google
    Add-Ons Team. In the meantime, you can continue to use Metadata in tools
    like QIIME 2 --- validation is provided there as well, it is just not an
    interactive process like Keemei. Thanks!

# {{ site.title }}

Keemei (canonically pronounced *key may*) is an open source [Google Sheets](http://www.google.com/sheets/about/) add-on for validating tabular bioinformatics file formats, including [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org/) metadata files.

Keemei supports validating the following file formats:

- [QIIME 2 metadata files](https://docs.qiime2.org/2018.2/tutorials/metadata/)
- [QIIME 1 mapping files](http://qiime.org/documentation/file_formats.html#metadata-mapping-files)
- [Qiita sample information files](https://qiita.ucsd.edu/static/doc/html/tutorials/prepare-information-files.html)
- [SRGD files](http://genegis.org) (e.g., for use with geneGIS)
