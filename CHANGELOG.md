# Keemei changelog

**Note on versioning:** the version numbers used here match the version numbers displayed to users in the Chrome Web Store. Sometimes there are gaps between release versions (e.g., version 2 jumps to version 5). This happens because each separate upload of Keemei to the web store increments the version number, and sometimes multiple uploads are necessary before a release is finalized (e.g., if the release is reviewed by an add-ons advisor and updates are required before it can go public). Therefore, the version numbering used here in the changelog and tagged GitHub releases will match the public release version displayed in the web store.

* Updated Qiita file format name to *Sample information file*.
* Keemei is now a verified Google Sheets add-on.

## Version 14 (2017-07-25)

This release adds full support for validating [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org) mapping files.

### Features
* Added full support for validating [QIIME 2 mapping files](https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.7/tutorials/metadata/#metadata-from-a-text-file)

## Version 13 (2017-06-28)

This release adds **experimental** support for validating [QIIME 2](https://qiime2.org) mapping files.

### Features
* Added **experimental** support for validating [QIIME 2 mapping files](https://docs.qiime2.org/2017.6/tutorials/metadata/#metadata-from-a-text-file) ([#79](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/79))

## Version 12 (2016-06-17)

Minor beta release with [Keemei paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13742-016-0133-6) citation information.

### Miscellaneous
* Added [Keemei paper](http://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13742-016-0133-6) citation information to website, "About" dialog, and readme

## Version 11 (2016-04-22)

Minor beta release with improved validation reporting and developer tools.

### Features
* Added number of cells validated and runtime to sidebar report ([#69](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/69))
* The error messages identifying duplicate cell locations (e.g., duplicate sample identifiers and barcode sequences) now only display the first 10 duplicates. This change results in error messages that are shorter and easier to digest for users and avoids some rendering performance degradation.
* Empty cells are now ignored when identifying duplicate cells, leading to fewer overlapping error messages.
* Identifying barcode length mismatches now ignores empty cells and only considers barcode length after trimming leading/trailing whitespace characters.
* Added "Developer tools" submenu to Keemei menu with tools to create simulated QIIME mapping file data and execute performance benchmarks presented in the Keemei paper.

## Version 10 (2016-02-10)

Minor beta release with a bug fix.

### Bug fixes
* Fixed minor Chrome CSS issue that caused parts of the sidebar to not render as intended

## Version 9 (2016-01-28)

### Bug fixes
* Fixed performance issue where sidebar would freeze, time out, or fail to display when processing a large number of invalid cells. Now sidebar only displays the first 250 invalid cells ([#62](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/62))

## Version 8 (2016-01-27)

Minor beta release with **experimental** support for validating Qiita sample template files.

### Features
* Added **experimental** support for validating [Qiita sample template files](https://qiita.ucsd.edu/static/doc/html/tutorials/prepare-templates.html#sample-template) ([#68](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/68))

### Miscellaneous
* Link to [PeerJ preprint](https://peerj.com/preprints/1670/) from website, "About" dialog, and readme ([#67](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/67))

## Version 7 (2016-01-22)

Minor beta release with a couple minor bug fixes / improvements.

### Features
* Improved error message clarity for misplaced columns in QIIME mapping files ([#63](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/63))

### Bug fixes
* Fixed issue where cell background colors and notes would remain as display artifacts when re-validating or clearing validation status of a sheet with a smaller data range ([#64](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/64))
* Removed broken link from "About" dialog

## Version 6 (2016-01-19)

Initial beta release.

### Features
* Added sidebar interface to display validation report and locate invalid cells ([#7](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/7))
* Added support for validating SRGD files (e.g., for use in [geneGIS](http://genegis.org/)) ([#51](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/51))

### Performance enhancements
* Keemei is now ~10x faster and supports validating much larger sheets than was previously possible ([#29](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/29))

### Bug fixes
* Improved error message for invalid column names. Previous message was misleading because it indicated the header contained invalid characters, but headers have more complicated rules. These rules are now stated in the error message ([#61](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/61))
* Validation of currency-formatted numbers (e.g., `(42.45)`) and other number/date formats now works as expected. Previous behavior was to mark as an empty cell if a cell's display value could not be computed by the [SheetConverter](https://sites.google.com/site/scriptsexamples/custom-methods/sheetconverter) library. Now uses the recently added `Range.getDisplayValues()` API in favor of SheetConverter, which also has improved performance ([#28](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/28))

## Version 5 (2015-06-17)

Minor alpha release with several usability enhancements.

### Features
* Valid cells (i.e., those without any errors or warnings) are no longer colored green as this information wasn't important to display. The green coloring could actually detract from the ease of locating invalid cells ([#58](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/58))
* Users are notified when a sheet is completely valid (i.e., no cells have errors or warnings) via a pop-up box ([#57](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/57))
* Error and warning messages are prefixed with a label to indicate their type (e.g., "Warning: Empty cell") ([#31](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/31))
* Cells with leading/trailing whitespace characters are now flagged with a warning ([#4](https://github.com/biocore/Keemei/issues/4))

## Version 2 (2015-04-14)
Initial alpha release.
